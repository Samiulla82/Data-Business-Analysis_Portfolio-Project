Hello everyone! My name is Samiulla, and this is my portfolio.
I love investigating different types of data, discovering insights, and representing it with beautiful visuals, have a background in Researching, Operation and financial data analysis.

I will use data wrangling techniques to clean, manipulate, and transform the data into a useful format for analysis. 
I will then use various visualization tools to identify patterns and trends in the data, such as the major types of complaints and any geographical correlations.

You can see more information in my CV.

This repository was created to showcase my analytical and technical skills (Excel, Python, SQL, Power BI, PowerPoint, and others).
