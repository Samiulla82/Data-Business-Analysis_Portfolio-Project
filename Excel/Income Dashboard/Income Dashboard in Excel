#Income Dashboard:
An income dashboard in Excel is a powerful tool that helps you track and analyze your income sources and financial health.

Key Features
The income dashboard template consists of four main worksheets:
       Dashboard Sheet Tab
       Data Sheet Tab
       List Sheet Tab
       Support Sheet Tab

Dashboard Sheet Tab:
The Dashboard Sheet is the heart of the income dashboard, featuring multiple charts and slicers for easy  data visualization and filtering.

In this dashboard sheet tab I have below given charts and visualizations:

Top Section Charts:

Total Amount by Payment Method: This doughnut chart displays the total amount of income by various payment methods such as Bank Transfer, Cash, Credit Deposit, PayPal, etc.
Total Amount by Source: A bar chart that visualizes the total income by source, including Rental Income, Salary, Consulting Fees, Freelance Projects, Dividends, Selling Art, Gifts, Interest, and Cashback.
Total Amount by Category: This 3D pie chart shows the total income by category, highlighting Property, Side Business, Freelancer, Investment, Job Income, etc.

Middle Section:
Total Amount by Date: This is a line chart. We are showing here income trends by date.

Bottom Section:
Total Amount by Received By: A column chart that presents the total income by the recipient, offering insights into who receives the most payments.

Slicers:
The dashboard includes slicers for Source, Received By, Recurring, Payment Method, Category, and Month, allowing for easy filtering and data analysis.

Data Sheet Tab:
The Data Sheet Tab is where I entered my transaction data. 
The columns include:

Date: Enter the transaction date.
Source: Select the income source from a dropdown list.
Amount: Enter the income amount.
Category: Select the income category from a dropdown list.
Payment Method: Choose the payment method from the dropdown list.
Notes: Add any relevant notes.
Recurring: Indicate whether the income is recurring (Yes/No).
Status: Enter the income status as received.
Received By: Specify who received the payment.
Contact Info: Provide the email address of the payer.
Month: This is a formula field. You donâ€™t need to enter anything here.

List Sheet Tab:
This sheet contains four columns: Source, Category, Payment Method, and Recurring. These columns are used to populate the dropdown lists in the Data Sheet Tab.

Calculation Tab
The Support Sheet is a hidden tab where I have created the multiple pivot tables. These pivot tables are connected to the dashboard sheet tab.
