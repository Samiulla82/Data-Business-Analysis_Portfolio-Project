Creating Excel Dashboards:

1. Prepare Your Data and Dashboard Sheet
I'll start by organizing my data. For this example, I used a sales dataset spanning 12 months, categorized by seller, product, state, sales, and profit.
I formatted the data in an Excel Table to allow for automatic updating of my dashboard.
I prepared five PivotTables to support the charts I plan to insert on the dashboard.

2. Designing Your Dashboard Canvas:
The foundation of a good dashboard is its design. Begin by setting the dashboard's background color.
Click the arrow at the intersection of the row and column labels to select the whole sheet, then apply the cell fill color.
I'm using a dark indigo, providing a visually appealing contrast for my charts and data elements. This is on a newly inserted blank sheet in my Excel workbook.
