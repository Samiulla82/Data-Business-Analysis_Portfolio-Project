What is Power Query?
Power Query is a powerful data pre-processing engine built into Excel and Power BI. 
It enables users to effortlessly bring in data from various sources and perform pre-processing or clean-up activities. 
Power Query automates common data tasks such as removing duplicates, combining files, merging (joining) datasets, 
adding derived columns, splitting or extracting data, and changing the shape or size of your data.

Power Query is accessible in both Excel and Power BI:

In Excel: Go to the DATA Ribbon and use the "Get & Transform Data" options.
In Power BI: Use the "Get Data" or "Transform" buttons.
Is Power Query Better Than SQL?
Power Query and SQL offer largely similar capabilities when it comes to data manipulation and transformation. 
However, Power Query provides more freedom and options, making it easier to learn and use for those who may not have a technical background in SQL.


Tasks to be Performed on the Data for Clean-up
Here are some common tasks that can be performed using Power Query to clean up your data:

Check for Blanks: Identify and handle blank or missing values in your dataset.
Check for Duplicates: Detect and remove duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.
Create ID (e.g., JohnD): Generate unique identifiers for your records, such as concatenating first names and initials.
Figure Out Term Start Date: Determine the start dates for terms or periods within your data.
Calculate Fee Status: Compute the status of fees, such as determining if fees are paid, pending, or overdue.
Using Power Query, these tasks can be automated, significantly reducing the time and effort required for data preparation
 and ensuring your data is accurate and ready for analysis.
